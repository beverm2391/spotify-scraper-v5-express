# Ben's Spotify Scraper

This code is designed to work with my [Lametric([]](https://lametric.com/en-US) LED clock/screen. I keep it in my music studio and I wanted to be able to see my spotify streams on it. This repo includes:
- puppeteer code to scrape `Spotify`
- code to dynamically parse html using `OpenAI` and `zod`

## Development
- uses pnpm
- uses express
